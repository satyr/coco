# Coco
is a [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) dialect that aims to be more radical and practical.

## Why
On its way to hide JavaScript's bad parts, CoffeeScript has accumulated own quirks:
[horrible variable scope](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/712),
[awkward ranges](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/746),
confusing/pointless keywords, long extension,
[and so on](https://github.com/satyr/coco/wiki/wtfcs).
Coco tries to amend them, entwining good parts of both.

## Principles
- Respect JavaScript/ECMAScript semantics.
- Die for [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
- Performance over readability.
- Perl over Ruby.
- Less keywords, punctuations and runtime errors.

## Differences

- [Improvements](https://github.com/satyr/coco/wiki/improvements)
- [Incompatibilities](https://github.com/satyr/coco/wiki/incompatibilities)
- [Side by Side Comparison](https://github.com/satyr/coco/wiki/side-by-side-comparison)

  Default arguments syntax has been changed accordingly.
  (`(a || b) ->` instead of `(a ||= b) ->`)

  making it work as pseudo-`let` and Coffee 1.0.0 compliant.

- Improved syntax-highlight in _src/index.html_.

### 0.2.0

- `@@` is now a shorthand for `arguments`.
- `do` can now indicate a call against indented arguments.
- `and` and `or` now close implicit calls, making you write even less parens:
  `f x and g y or z` -> `f(x) && g(y) || z;`

- Renamed `--stdio` to `--stdin`.

### 0.1.6
- Added character/word literal:
  `\C + \++` -> `'C' + '++';`
- Retrieving multiple properties at once is now possible:
  `a[b, c]` -> `[a[b], a[c]];`

  - `a[b, c] = d` -> `a[b] = d[0], a[c] = d[1];`
  - `a{b, c} = d` -> `a.b = d.b, a.c = d.c;`
- Compound assignments can now destructure:
  `[@a, @b] /= c` -> `this.a /= c[0], this.b /= c[1];`

### 0.1.5
- Conditional control structures can now be anaphoric;
  `that` within `if`, `while` or `case` block now refers to the condition value.

### 0.1.4
- `.` and its families can now be used with numbers and strings, instead of `[]`.
  `a.0.'0'` compiles to `a[0]['0']`.
- Added syntax for cloning objects;
  `obj{key:val}` acts like a simple version of ES5 `Object.create`,
  creating a prototypal child of `obj` and assigning to `.key` with `val`.

Release.
